# Creating Technical Debt

Tech debt is not ideal, but it's a fact of life. It exists and we should know how to deal with it during the review process.

If a review highlights an appreciable amount of change that, whilst being necessary, will not harm the codebase if not done
straight away, then a tech debt story/task should be written as part of the review process. The review should reference, and
link to, the created ticket(s) and the ticket(s) should link to the review conversation/explanation from which they arose.
